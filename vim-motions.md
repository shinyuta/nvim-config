# Vim Motions That I Learned About

This is a sentence to test your vim motions.

Every vim motion has a capital letter counterpart.

For example:

- i, insert, I, insert at beginning of line
- a, append after char, A, append after line.

Here are useful vim motions:

- f (find), F (backwards), ; for repeat.
- i, insert, I, insert beginning.
- a, append, A, insert end.
- G, top line, gg, bottom line
- M, middle of the document.
- dw, delete word.
- y, yank.
- p, paste after, P, paste before.
- ., (dot operator), repeats last operation.

### Code actions

- %, moves to the end of the scope (bracket, parentheses, etc).
